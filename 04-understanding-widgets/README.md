Chapter 4: Understanding
Widgets

You may have heard that everything in Flutter is a widget. While that might not be
absolutely true, most of the time when you’re building apps, you only see the top
layer: widgets. In this chapter, you’ll dive into widget theory. You’ll explore:
• Widgets
• Widget rendering
• Flutter Inspector
• Types of widgets
• Widget lifecycle
It’s time to jump in!
Note: This chapter is mostly theoretical. You’ll make just a few code changes
to the project near the end of the chapter.
