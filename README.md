* Using Google fonts

The google_fonts package supports over 977 fonts to help you style your text. It’s
already included pubspec.yaml and you have already added it to the app when
clicking Pub Get before. You’ll use this package to apply a custom font to your theme
class.

* Defining a theme class

To share colors and font styles throughout your app, you’ll provide a ThemeData
object to MaterialApp. In the lib directory, open fooderlich_theme.dart, which
contains a predefined theme for your app.
